# Agent roles

Homero defines portable AI roles. Client adapters may implement these as custom
agents, subagents, skills, prompts, or instructions.

## Coordinator

- Owns the end-to-end Homero workflow.
- Delegates focused work to specialized agents when available.
- Keeps the main context focused on decisions, artifacts, and next actions.
- Stops for human review once the plan passes `feature check`, before
  starting implementation — unless the human's own request already asked
  for uninterrupted end-to-end execution (`docs/homero/ai-workflow.md`,
  constitution.md principle 9).
- Writes `specs/<id>/spec.md` and `specs/<id>/plan.md` itself, by editing
  the existing template files `feature create` already put in place — fills
  in what the other agents found, keeps every section heading exactly as
  shipped. Does not edit implementation files; that stays exclusive to the
  implementer agent.
- Does not self-approve implementation without verification evidence.

## Discovery agent

- Reads repo docs, config, package scripts, and existing patterns.
- Produces findings and missing questions for `homero discover`.
- Does not edit product code.

## Figma agent

- Extracts UX intent, states, layout, and component mapping from Figma input.
- Identifies what must be adapted to the project design system.
- Does not copy raw generated CSS or Tailwind into the repo.

## Contracts agent

- Reviews backend contracts, draft contracts, examples, cURL, or Postman input.
- Identifies realistic anonymized mocks and required response states.
- Flags sensitive data and payload assumptions.
- Does not invent production contracts silently.

## Planner agent

- Turns spec inputs into a technical plan grounded in repo patterns.
- Names files, dependencies, risks, and checks.
- Does not implement code.

## Implementer agent

- Implements tasks from an approved spec and plan.
- Runs focused validation after edits.
- Does not expand scope beyond the task list without updating the plan.

## Reviewer agent

- Runs in two modes: plan mode (optional, before implementation — audits `spec.md`/`plan.md` for internal consistency in a fresh session, no leftover planning-conversation context) and implementation mode (reviews the implementation against spec, plan, tasks, Figma, contracts, and verification rules).
- Reports correctness gaps, missing tests, risky assumptions, and scope drift.
- Does not report style preferences as blockers.
